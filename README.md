## Objectives<a name="objectives"></a>
<b>The Amazon</b> is the worldâ€™s largest rainforest. It absorbs more greenhouse gases than any other tropical forest. The forest helps stabilize climate, provides home to a multitude of plants and wildlife species, helps maintain the water cycle, protects against flood, drought, and erosions.<BR><BR>
But in the recent years deforestation activities in the forest have accelerated. This has contributed to reduced biodiversity, habitat loss, climate change, and other devastating effects.<BR><BR>
Data about the location of deforestation and human encroachment of forests can help governments and organizations implement effective solutions towards regaining the ecological balance.<BR><BR>
In this project we analyze satellite imagery of the Amazon basin to track human footprint. We use convolutional neural networks(CNNs) to classify the images into categories of atmospheric conditions and land cover/land usage classes. We explore techniques to improve the model's performance and also illustrate how to visualize the CNN activation maps.<BR><BR>
The image data used is from the the [Kaggle site](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/planet-understanding-the-amazon-from-space/data) 

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
The code has been developed using Python version 3.7.12<BR> 
The main libraries used are tensorflow, keras, pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib.<BR>
The version of tensorflow used in the implementation : 2.8.0<BR>
The version of keras used in the implementation : 2.8.0 (The keras API is integrated with tensorflow)<BR>
The version of sklearn  used in the implementation : 1.0.2<BR>

The tqdm library is used to track the progress during model training using a progress or meter bar.<BR>
Command to install the tqdm library:
- pip install tqdm

The link below has further details on the installation of the tqdm library
